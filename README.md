# NodeJS-Chat
Simple NodeJS chat using Socket.IO, based off of the chat script from the official Socket.IO website.
# Notes
This is a simple chat script, and does not handle any data other than re/directing socket data. This means that it IS vulnerable to XSS and of the sort, and is not to be used in any sort of production without modification. Protection from such vulnerabilities may come in later versions, but not as of now.
